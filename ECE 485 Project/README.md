# ECE-485-Project
This is a project repository for ECE 485 PSU.

We will be simulating a last level cache for a new processor that can be used by multiple processors in a shared memory configuration. We will have to design this cache to have 16MB of memory, 64-byte lines, and be 8-way set associative. It will employ a write allocate policy and use the MESI protocol, as well as having a pseudo LRU scheme.
